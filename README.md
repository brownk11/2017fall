what do you meme
My name is Kwame Brown, Iâ€™m in my senior year here at New Paltz classes I have taken include  Data Structures, Discrete Mathematics, Internet Programming, Web Site Management, Assembly Language, Digital Logic, Networking, Software Engineering. I am familiar with github, android studio and Eclipse. Languages I am competent in include Java and HTML.
I can see myself using this class when I hopefully am able to get a job in web development when I graduate and maybe creating my own website.
